# Tableau-Project
GenNext is a Life Sciences company which wants to explore the data on drugs
generated by Food and Drug Administration (FDA). They have asked you to create
dashboards through which you can visualize the drugs consumed across locations,
compare the effectiveness of drugs and identify the company that has the drugs with
lower side effects. The Vice President of the GenNext Life Sciences company wants
the dashboards with the following details:
Dashboard 1: Adverse events occurred due to drug consumption across locations
and companies
Dashboard 2: Drug comparator
Dashboard 3: Adverse events across multiple parameters
